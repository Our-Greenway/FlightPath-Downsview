[FlightPath Downsview](https://flightpath.ourgreenway.ca/) is a TypeScript React tool designed to help people who are deaf and hard of hearing learn more about Downsview Park during Cycling Without Age rides (the “Navigator” feature). It also includes a “Pathfinder” tool to guide users along the shortest routes between park attractions.
